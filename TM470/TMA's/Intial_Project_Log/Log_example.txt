Log sheet no. 5

Session no. 9 & 10

TMA 02 date: 17 April

Time spent: 2 hours

Work. Finished off the last bits and pieces for the TMA. Reread the guide on structuring, styling and editing reports to see if I had covered everything. Rechecked TMA material to make sure that I’d included everything I was asked for. Carried out spell check. Print out – sort out – that’s it. TMA finished.

Problems. Found it difficult to organise my TMA in what would seem a logical manner for reading. Great difficulty in writing about how I tackled the TMA. Must continue to go over the sections on effective report writing.

Comments. Great relief in getting to this point. Finally I have a project skeleton. But shouldn’t wait for the verdict before pressing on!

Next work planned. Final check of TMA. Finished on time but still apprehensive about the work I have to do.
