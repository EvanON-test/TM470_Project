        TUTOR'S COMMENTS AND ADVICE TO STUDENT: <br /><br />Word count: 7671, exceeding the target word count of 4000 words (+/- 10%).<br />
<br />
Spelling Grammar and punctuation: Academic quality was relatively high. Word's inbuilt spellchecker did pick up a number of minor grammar errors. Remember to run the spelling and grammar check, prior to handin for future assignments.<br />
<br />
Referencing: A list of 18, alphabetically ordered, sources included in your References list, all of which conform exactly to the Harvard Referencing Standard. This shows development from TMA01.<br />
<br />
You have included 11 citations in the body of your report. As a general guideline, for academic work, 8 to 12 citations should be included for every 1000 words. Working on the lower figure, for 4000 words you should be aiming for around 30 citations, so perhaps consider increasing the number of citations for TMA03.<br />
For academic work, any citation in the body of an academic report, must have a corresponding entry in the report's Reference List.<br />
<br />
Sources which are reviewed but not directly cited in the report are then placed in a separate 'Bibliography'. There is a methodology, as some academic sources advocate, for the use of a single 'Bibliography' list (typically for final published work). For academic marking the first method is much more convenient for markers to confirm (for example) that every citation links to a Reference List item.<br />
<br />
I noted that all of the reference list items, that appeared in your TMA01 report, were correctly presented in this TMA02 report. If you change citations and a Reference List item is no longer cited, rather than 'lose' the information source, you can move that source into a second 'Bibliography' listing. This allows you to gain 'credit' for sources that were read or reviewed but not directly cited in the main report. (another good example of the benefit of the separation of the Reference List and the Bibliography).<br />
<br />
The TMA02 'Project Activities' section (on the TM470 website) details that progress needed to be demonstrated in the following areas;<br />
<br />
a.Documenting progress in analysing your chosen problem and in developing a solution using appropriate technical concepts and principles.<br />
<br />
You have shown progress in both research and the development of coding.<br />
<br />
b.Identifying the key information sources that will inform the project in the next phase.<br />
<br />
You have developed your research sources but perhaps need to add to those academic sources which support your decision making as the project progresses.<br />
<br />
c.Reviewing progress against your original plan, especially any practical activity undertaken.<br />
<br />
You have shown revision of your GANNT chart, in light of emerging issues. You have made very good progression on the coding of your application.<br />
<br />
d.Evaluating possible legal, social, ethical or professional concerns arising from the project.<br />
<br />
Reasonable consideration of LSEPI issues demonstrated. You may need to add a little more depth to your consideration of EDI's.<br />
<br />
e.Reflecting on your approach to project working, identifying things that you do successfully and productively, and factors relating to your working style and time management that frustrate progress.<br />
<br />
Good identification of the underestimation of time in your feedback, reflected in your project log and planning tools.<br />
<br />
f.Refining the goals and content of your project in the light of: feedback from your tutor; further reading; your experience of practical progress so far; and interaction with stakeholders.<br />
<br />
You demonstrated good reflection, particularly in implementing changes suggested by TMA01 feedback.<br />
<br />
g.Identifying any additional resources and/or unanticipated skills and activities you need to carry out your project, plus any associated risks and revise your plan as appropriate.<br />
<br />
A much better section on risk which showed good development from TMA01. Just the calculation of overall risk to amend for TMA03.<br />
<br />
In summary, a very good second TMA Evan, evidencing progression very well. There are some areas where you can continue to develop, as we head towards TMA03, but, overall, you have largely met the requirements of most of the Learning Outcomes for this TMA.<br /><br /><br /></body></html>
