        TUTOR'S COMMENTS AND ADVICE TO STUDENT: <br /><br />Word Count : 11,777, exceeding the target word count of 5000 words (+/- 10%).<br />
<br />
Spelling Grammar and punctuation: Academic quality was very high with no errors detected by Word's spellchecker.<br />
<br />
Referencing: A list of 28, alphabetically ordered, reference sources included in your Reference List, all of which conform exactly to the Harvard Referencing Standard. This shows development form the 18 sources included for TMA02.<br />
<br />
You have included 7 citations in the body of your report, which strangely is less than the 11 included for TMA02.<br />
As a general guideline, for academic work, 8 to 12 citations should be included for every 1000 words. Working on the lower figure, for 5000 words you should be aiming for around 40 citations.<br />
Development is needed here for the EMA, in terms of increasing the total number of report citations (both direct and indirect).<br />
Although increasing the range of reference sources is good development from TMA02, these sources must then be used (cited) to support your work. Try and develop this for the EMA.<br />
Remember that every item listed in your Reference List should link to one or more citations in the main body of the report.<br />
<br />
The TMA03 'Project Activities' section (on the TM470 website) details that progress needed to be demonstrated in the following areas;<br />
<br />
a. Refining the goals and content of your project in the light of progress. Assess the risks to the availability of resources you need to complete your project. Plan the final phase of the project.<br />
You have, explicitly stated the project's goals and have clearly identified a 'solution' in the form of a developed application.<br />
<br />
b. Gathering, analysing and evaluating relevant information to complete your project successfully.<br />
Development here from TMA02 and you showed clear evidence of evaluation of the relevance of researched information. More citation use is required for the EMA.<br />
<br />
c. Demonstrating comprehension of the key literature that underpin the project by relating and/or applying them to the project work undertaken so far.<br />
Good evidence of research into existing literature within the problem domain. More citation use is required for the EMA.<br />
<br />
d. Demonstrating and applying a systematic understanding of the fundamental technical concepts and principles relevant to your project.<br />
Good, detailed work linking previously studied OU Modules to your development.<br />
<br />
e. Demonstrating and applying an understanding of the context in which technical knowledge can be applied.<br />
You include code examples, file structures and example UI screenshots.<br />
<br />
f. Analysing a practical problem and, where appropriate, devise and implement a solution which should be within the area of your chosen specialist route, if applicable, building on and extending the knowledge and skills developed throughout your previous OU studies.<br />
You have included good detail of the development of the project from TMA02. Try and include a specific example of a problem you encountered in say the programming phase and how you overcame this problem.<br />
<br />
g. Demonstrating the ability to report clearly and critically on the outcomes of your project work.<br />
You demonstrated self-critical appraisal and honest reflection.<br />
<br />
h. Reviewing progress against your latest project plan. Identify major risks to success in the next phase and propose ways to manage these appropriately.<br />
You make explicit reference to your latest GANNT chart and have adequately assessed major risks. Your inclusion of the project log informs the GANNT chart iterations and should continue to provide this 'cross reference' through to the production of the EMA.<br />
<br />
i. Learning independently. Communicate regularly with your tutor on progress, seeking guidance as and when needed.<br />
You have demonstrated reasonable communication with me and requested advice when it was appropriate.<br />
<br />
You should continue to maintain your project journal, as project activities are completed, including a record of what you have done and why, what you have read, problems you have encountered and how you overcame them.<br />
<br />
In summary, an very good TMA 03 Evan, which shows progression from TMA02 and which addresses most of the feedback points provided.<br />
<br />
There are still some areas where you can continue to develop, as we head towards the final EMA, such as the inclusion of an introduction and conclusion, just to round the EMA document off as a correctly formatted academic report.<br />
You will also need to add to the citations and reference sources as you head towards the EMA.<br />
The final target word count is 10,000 words which you are currently exceeding so you may be advised to try and review the project and streamline any sections that you consider 'wordy'.<br />
However, your progress to date leads me to believe that you are capable of achieving a very good grade in the final EMA<br />
Overall, you have met almost all of the requirements of the Learning Outcomes for TMA 03.<br />
